## Context
Host parameter IDs are a stable contract once shipped; Phase 6b adds many parameters.

Plan: `docs/ROADMAP.md` Phase 6b, `docs/specs/control-inventory.md`, decision D15 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`, OQ8..OQ14 in `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`.

## Higher Goal
Every Nord Stage 4 front-panel control from the manual exists in the emulator with a layout rect, a renderer and a binding (Bound, UiOnly or Unsupported), drawn as a 2.5D panel shared by the standalone app and the plugin editor.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Committed snapshot of every param ID with type, range and default
- [ ] Test fails on remove or rename, passes on additive change
- [ ] Test asserts ID uniqueness

## Out of Scope
- Redistributing Clavia photos, manuals or firmware; `.reference/` stays git-ignored
- Renaming or removing host parameter IDs shipped by the DAW plugin (stable contract)

## Summary of Changes
